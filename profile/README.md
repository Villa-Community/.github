# Villa Programming Language

We are a community developing a new programming language for the future of application development. Villa is extending Kotlin to new places and capabilities.

## What is Villa?

Villa is a new programming language developed by the community, our goal is to make writting applications easier for everyone. Villa uses less syntax and more functions in less keywords.

Our language has manu built-in libraries and dependencies which are already built-in to the compiler, so you do not need to import missing libraries and dependencies in your code. Sometimes conflicts can also be hard to handle, Villa has a built-in system in our syntax that helps resolve conflicts using generations and versioning.

## Villa for multiplatform

Villa is built on top of Kotlin, so you can build on many platforms in one project, it's easier to maintain and write. Villa does require JVM installed on your computer, JVM 23 or later is supported.
